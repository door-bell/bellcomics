# About

The objective of this project was to create a functional blog-style site that
allows for an admin to log in and post new comics. I wanted users to be able
to sign up and get an email each time a comic was posted.

# To Do

`
1. ~~Style login and create/edit comic pages.~~

2. ~~Add admin navigation between index page and comics dashboard.~~

3. Add "newsletter" for basic users.

4. Figure out mailing system.
